University Domains and Names List
=================================

A JSON list that contains domains, names and countries of the most of the universities of the world.

It is very useful if you are building a web service for students.

You can easily create a validation script that checks the email domain. You can also automatically generate user's country and university by looking their emails.

Feel free to update the list.

    "domain": "sabanciuniv.edu",
